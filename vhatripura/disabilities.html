            Disabilities</b></h4>
        <p>Since 2016, VHAT has been collaborating in various activities with Shishu Sarothi , an organization based in
          Guwahati, dedicated to early intervention and rehabilitation, education, advocacy, awareness, and the
          protection
          of rights for children and individuals with disabilities in North-East India. In relation to this we have been
          actively involved in implementing a Scholarship Program, aiming to empower students with disabilities to
          pursue higher education. Our goal is to counteract the declining trend and significant drop in the number of
          students with disabilities in higher education while fostering employment opportunities and the inclusion of
          Persons with Disabilities in the mainstream.</p>
        <p>
          The Indus Towers Scholarship Program (www.ssscholarship.org), a CSR initiative of Indus Towers Ltd,
          implemented by Shishu Sarothi was launched in 2016 ,where VHAT was the local partner for Tripura State, to
          encourage and support students with disability. From Tripura, 51 students have already benefited from the
          scholarship support in pursuing their higher education, many of them securing jobs and leading a life of
          dignity
          and financial independence. This year 11 students/scholars were selected from different parts of Tripura for
          scholarship. The selected students would receive support for their educational expenses until the completion
          of
          their courses, and some needy students would also receive additional assistance for study materials, assistive
          devices, hostel fees and conveyance.</p>
        <p>
          Annual Scholarship Award Ceremony of the "Indus Towers Scholarship Program" was held on 21st November
          2023 in DDRC Hall Shyamali Bazar Agartala, where Scholarship certificates were given to 11 selected students.

        This was new initiative of VHAT with support from the Social Welfare & Social Education Department under
        Government of Tripura. This shelter home is for the welfare & rehabilitation of persons living with mental
        illness
        who have been cured, who do not need further hospitalization, who are homeless & who are not accepted by their
        families or guardians and are in need of shelter, care and protection. To meet this objective, the Govt. of
        Tripura
        has established ‘SHANTINEER’–a Half Way Home at Narsingarh, West Tripura wherein 25 female and 25 male
        cured mental patients can be accommodated .<p>
          VHAT could initiate this project in October 2023 with 25 female inmates sent by the Modern Psychiatric
          Hospital, Narsingarh. In March 2024 , again 15 male in mates were sent to Half Way Home by the Modern
          Psychiatric Hospital (MPH).</p>

          Tripura. It was organized to mark the International Day of Persons with Disabilities on December 3, 2023
          which is celebrated this year with the theme “United in action to rescue and achieve the SDGs for, with and by
          persons with disabilities,” and, ensuring accessibility for persons with disabilities is the first step
          towards
          inclusion. In the beginning Madam Smitha Mol, M.S.(IAS) Director, Social Welfare & Social Education,
          Tripura addressed the participants. Thereafter, Mr.Achintam Kilikdar, Deputy Commissioner for Persons with
          Disabilities, Tripura, began his address by sharing that the Rights of Person with Disabilities Act, 2016
          which
          replaces the earlier Person with Disabilities Act, 1995 is a comprehensive legal framework that reflects a
          commitment to creating an inclusive and accessible society.</p>
        <p><b>Participants:</b> Total 37 people, including state- and district-level officials from government
          departments, like
          Public Works (Roads), Public Works (Building), Municipal Council, Urban Development, Rural Development,
          Transport, Housing & Construction Board, Social Welfare & Education and one representative from All Tripura
          Blind Association.</p>
        <p><b>Working Session on Accessible Built – Environment:
          </b>Ms. Amvalika Senapati, Deputy Director, Shishu Sarothi, conducted the working session on Built-Environment
          Accessibility. She initiated the session with concept of disability and rights-based approach. She shared the
          various barriers faced by persons with disabilities in the society such as, physical, social, institutional
          and
          communication barriers and said that addressing these barriers are essential for creating inclusive and
          accessible
          environment. She showed pictorial presentation depicting various barriers in the built-environment.
          Thereafter she highlighted upon the concept of accessibility and its importance and emphasized that
          accessibility plays an important role in breaking the vicious cycle of poverty and disability as it enables a
          person with disability to access good education, which ensures good job opportunity or livelihood options,
          thereby leading to economic empowerment and reducing their dependence on other for their survival. She also
          shared that accessibility also ensures that persons with disabilities are able to live a life with
          dignity, respect and independence and get equal opportunities to participate. Accessibility includes both
          physical and virtual environment of a person, as well as rules, policies, practices and attitudes of people
          affecting the lives of persons with disabilities. As per the Right of Person with Disabilities (RPwD) Act,
          2016
          the provisions vis-à-vis the built - environment, stipulates that :
          <li>No establishment shall be granted permission to build any structure if the building plan does
