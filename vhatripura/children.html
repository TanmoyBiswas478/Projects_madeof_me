        <h4 class="text-center"><b>Family Based Alternative Care of
            Children in need</b></h4>
        This was an organized effort of VHAT for reintegration of children in their family or in extended family .
        Social
        investigation was done of the families of children who were staying in the CCIs/Homes, by visiting their
        families
        and preparing the social investigation reports. If the possibility of reintegration was there, we placed the
        report to
        CWC. After further verification we did the integration with permission from the CWC. We were doing the
        follow up and helping the reintegrated children for their study and income generation of their guardians and
        overall development of the children keeping them within the family. This project was supported by <b>The Miracle
          Foundation India.</b> We worked as per the UN Guidelines for Alternative Care of Children, where it stated
        that:
        “Family is the fundamental group of society and the natural environment for the growth, well-being and
        protection of children, and efforts should be primarily directed to enabling the child to remain in or return to
        the
        care of his/her parents, or when appropriate, other close family members.”
        <p><b>Approach/strategy:</b></p>
        <li><b>Home visits and family crisis intervention:</b> regular visits to the homes of children placed in our
          care(CCIs) to
          assess family dynamics and address any crises or challenges they may be facing. Through working closely with
          families to resolve issues and our aim was to create a conductive environment for child’s return.</li>
        <li><b>Social investigation Reports:</b> through investigations to understand the root causes of family
          separation and
          identify the necessary interventions to facilitate reintegration, the report was prepared. </li>
        <li><b>Five well-being domains:</b> We focused on five key domains of family well-being: Economic stability,
          access
          to education and health care, social support networks, safe and stable housing and emotional well-being. </li>
        <li><b>Continuous Follow- Up and Family Support:</b> Our commitment to reintegration extends beyond the
          initialization process. </li>
        <li><b>Mental Health focus:</b> this included counseling, therapy and psychosocial support to promote healing,
          resilience and positive mental health outcomes.</li>
        <li><b>Community Awareness Program:</b> We are committed to raising awareness within communities about the
          importance of family-based care for children, through workshops, seminars and outreach initiatives. Another
          aim was to educate people in the community about the benefits of various government schemes for providing
          benefits to the children. In 2023-24 , we organized 23 Community Awareness Meetings with totally 364 people
          in West Tripura , Khowai & Sepahijala District.</li>

  approach to child reintegration encompassed proactive family engagement, targeted interventions and ongoing 
  support to ensure that children were reintegrated into safe, loving and stable family environment. By prioritizing 
  family well-being and mental health, we strived to facilitate successful and sustainable reunifications that enable 
  to children to thrive within their families. VHAT , through this FBAC project could provide livelihood support to 
  three families for cloth selling and fast food business. Four parents got psychological counseling and parenting 
  skill training. !n 2023-24 we could reintegrate 43 children from five CCIs run by VHAT.</p>

  <h4 class="text-center"><b>Campaign for Child Marriage Free India</b></h4>
  Child marriage remains a grave concern in our society, a practice that not only deprives children of their rightful 
childhood but also poses long-lasting repercussions on their lives. According to the fifth National Family Health 
Survey conducted between 2019 and 2021, a staggering 23.3% of girls between the ages of 20 and 24 are 
married before reaching the legal age of 18 years. This statistic serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for 
collective action to address this issue.
<p>Being encouraged by Kailash Satyarthi Children's Foundation VHAT agreed to join a campaign “Child Marriage 
  Free India” on Monday, the 16th of October 2023, aims to eliminate child marriage in India by 2030, thereby 
  saving 1.5 million girls getting married each year. The campaign was being run with the focus on implementing 
  the existing government policies and laws in the country that ensure child protection, health and education.
  VHAT and its network organization organized this campaign in Tripura in all eight districts on the same day.</p>
